            h2 How Firefox startup tabs work
          .content
            p
              | Firefox allows you to open multiple tabs automatically on browser start.
              | To do this, Firefox expects a single string of URLs separated by the pipe character <code>|</code> in the Homepage settings.
            p
              | Each URL between two pipes is opened as a separate tab when Firefox starts.

            p
              | While the feature itself is powerful, editing pipe-separated URLs in a single-line input field is error-prone and frustrating.
            p
              | TabsOnFire 🔥🗂️ turns that hidden configuration string into a clear, editable list so you can manage your startup tabs comfortably.

              li Reorder, edit, or remove any URL as needed.
              li Copy the generated pipe-separated snippet.
              li Paste it into Firefox → Settings → Home → "Homepage and new windows".

            h3 Edit an Existing Snippet
            ol
